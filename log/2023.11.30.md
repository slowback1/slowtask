**How long did I work on it

About an hour and a half

**What I did

Added a dialog that appears whenever a player gains enough experience to level up, indicating that the player should choose a stat point to raise.

**What I learned 

This was my first time really working with the native html `dialog` element in a real project setting, and it was good!  Opening /  closing the dialog was relatively simple to do, and getting a decent looking "darkened" backdrop was as simple as this snippet of CSS:

```css
.level-up::backdrop {  
    background-color: #111;  
    opacity: 0.4;  
}
```

One thing to note for the future, though, is that you probably shouldn't style the dialog with a  global selector, because altering the `display` property in any way will break the native functionality.  Instead, select only when the dialog is open, for example, do _not_ do this:

```css
dialog {
	display: flex;
}
```
Instead, do this:

```css
dialog[open] {
	display: flex;
}
```

**What I struggled with

Testing the proper opening and closing of dialogs was somewhat a pain, because it seems like whatever dom mocking is happening in `jsdom` / `svelte-testing-library` is still behind on HTML standards, and such doesn't actually support `dialog.showModal()` and `dialog.close` .  It does support `dialog.open` however, so I was able to work around this by just checking if the function existed in my open/close helper functions, like this:

```typescript
function openDialog() {  
  ref.showModal ? ref.showModal() : ref.open = true;  
}

function closeDialog() {  
  ref.close ? ref.close() : ref.open = false;  
}
```
