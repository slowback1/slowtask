**How long did I work on it

About 2 hours

**What I did

Added a new "section" to the tasks page for listing out and adding/editing "regular tasks"

**What I learned 

On this project, not a whole lot, since this was a lot of "standard" TDD cycles and implementing new features using patterns I've used in other parts of the project.  Over the past few weeks I have been working on a "svelte starter kit" project that I hope to use as a jumping off point for future projects.  I ported over quite a few bits of functionality from this project into it, and vice-versa, and I am sure I will continue to do the same back and forth for a while yet.  

I dockerized the starter kit app recently, and I found it to be a thankfully easy experience to fit a working Svelte app into a docker container.  I would have been shocked if this weren't the case, but nonetheless glad that docker isn't one of those "hidden problems" that frameworks can have.

**What I struggled with

I struggled to remember where I left off from last time and what I was aiming to do.  I usually have a few days to a week between sessions, but this time I had over weeks between my last session and today.
