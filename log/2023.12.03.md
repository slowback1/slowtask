**How long did I work on it

About an hour and a half

**What I did

Refined the idea of, and started implementing the concept of "regular tasks" (ie: recurring tasks that happen daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)

**What I learned 

Something that I realized over this session was how little of Svelte's features I'm actually using.  In the Github stats for this project, the project is 75% TypeScript code, nearly all of which is framework-agnostic code that could be theoretically reused in a lot of different projects.  I think it speaks to the strength of the framework that I am able to make a working application of the complexity that this one has using as little of the features of that I am, because at this point the main features I am using from the framework are routing and the ability to have easily modular components.  

The message bus helps out with this a lot, as most frameworks also assume you will  be heavily relying on them for state management (React is the most extreme  example of this), so not having to rely on the framework at all for that, and instead rolling up my own reusable solution for that has been helpful in creating a largely portable codebase.

**What I struggled with

I've intentionally been avoiding installing third party libraries whenever possible, which does mean I've been needing to "reinvent the wheel" for a lot of functions that I would normally rely on libraries like lodash and moment to cover.
