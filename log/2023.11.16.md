**How long did I work on it

About an hour

**What I did

Started working on a "player data" feature, for attaching a basic experience / level / stat system to a user.  Primarily did work with what the data structure should be, and creating a class to handle update operations.

**What I learned 

I've come to realize that I'm not using very many Svelte features, and that is probably a good thing, as it will make a large portion of the codebase portable.  I think this speaks to the strength of Svelte that I am able to largely structure the project my own way, without having to worry about doing things "the Svelte Way".  A good example of this is the class that I spent most of this session working on, take one of the core methods the class contains:

```typescript
addExperience(experience: number) {  
  let playerData = this.getPlayerData();  
  
  playerData.experience.currentExperience += experience;  
  
  if (playerData.experience.currentExperience >= 100) {  
   this.processLevelUp(playerData);  
  }  
  
  this.saveChanges(playerData);  
}
```

In React-world, `getPlayerData` and `saveChanges` would have to ultimately get/set state somewhere, probably far up the component tree in order for React to trigger a rerender.  Here, however, both of these methods deal with the Message Bus that I've implemented for this project, which exists completely separately from anything in the Svelte ecosystem, and I can just `subscribe` to the data that this is manipulating within whatever Svelte component needs this, with something as simple as this:

```typescript
let playerData: PlayerData = null;

onMount(() => {
	MessageBus.subscribe<PlayerData>(Messages.PlayerData, (value) => playerData =  value);
})
```

Svelte is then smart enough to handle reactivity with this simple "let", instead of having to specifically call it out in a setState somewhere.

**What I struggled with

Nothing much in the way of coding, sometimes I second-guess myself when it comes to coming up with good data structures, and this session was no different, but I think what I came up with is alright for the time being.
