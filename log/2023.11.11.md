How long did I work on it

About half an hour

What I did

Styled the task component, and the task page in general based on designs I drew up a few weeks ago

What I learned 

Not a whole lot, I was mostly just writing CSS.

What I struggled with

"struggle" is probably not the right word, but I do think Svelte's way of handling styling child components is a little strange, see example below:

```css
.task-item :global(.icon) {  
    width: var(--font-size-small);  
    height: var(--font-size-small);  
    fill: var(--color-lavender);  
}
```

having to wrap your selector around the :global pseudoselector isn't a dealbreaker, per se, but it does feel a little off in CSS.  In a sense, having the DX for it be a little strange is probably a good  thing, since it incentivizes not having parents style their child components very often (and honestly, the above example is a pretty good example of something that could probably just be a "size" and "color" prop on the child icon components)
