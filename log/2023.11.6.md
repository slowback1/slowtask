How long did I work on it

About an hour

What I did

Finished implementing the data syncing service, which listens to relevant messages on the message bus, and sends a PATCH request to the backend to update user data if the user is logged in

What I learned 

Event driven architecture makes testing disparate pieces of functionality like this way easier than I've found it to be on projects that aren't architected like this. 

What I struggled with

I added debouncing to the actual data syncing, and while I think that is ultimately the right choice so that the app is not bombarding the backend with meaningless requests, it did make testing some pieces of the functionality a little bit trickier than I would have liked, and I ended up settling for a less-than-ideal order of operations of  what gets called when.  The version of the class I settled with will tell the message bus that it started syncing data immediately, instead of waiting for the debounce to finish to send that message, which means that the syncing indicator in the header will be in the "syncing"  state a little earlier than when the app is actually syncing.
