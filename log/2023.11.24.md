**How long did I work on it

About 2 1/2 hours

**What I did

Added a basic user experience system, which causes the player to gain experience as they complete tasks and level up (leveling up currently does nothing).  

**What I learned

I realized  during this session that most of my components only really care about the stored value of something in my message bus, so I'm swinging back on the idea of having subscription / current  value live in a separate class.  For example, I made a component today that displays the player's  current experience in an experience bar.  All of the JS for that component looks like this:

```typescript
let currentExperience = 0;  
  
onMount(() => {  
  let unsubscribe = MessageBus.subscribe<PlayerData>(Messages.PlayerData, value => currentExperience = value?.experience?.currentExperience ?? 0);  
  
  return () => unsubscribe();  
});
```

This is probably not complex enough to care about moving to a separate class most of the time, and anyways, this lets the component live more standalone from the rest of the system, since I can easily test it by sending arbitrary messages through the message bus and the component will react accordingly.

I also learned about the `meter` HTML element, which you can use like a read-only version of a `range` input.  It's pretty cool, and I think the default styles of it look decent.  The code I used for my experience bar  component looked like this:

```html
<meter  
  role="meter"  
  min="0"  
  max="100"  
  id="experience-bar"  
  data-testid="experience-bar"  
  value={currentExperience}  
  title={`${currentExperience}exp`}  
></meter>
```

**What I struggled with

There was a weird bug with testing a component that relied on Svelte's `onMount` .  I ended up having to add this to my vite.config to fix it, but I'm not entirely sure what this is doing:

```typescript
alias: [  
  {  
   find: /^svelte$/,  
   replacement: 'svelte/internal'  
  }  
]
```
