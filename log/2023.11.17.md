**How long did I work on it

About 15 minutes

**What I did

Experimented with using Svelte's `onMount` outside of a Svelte component

**What I learned 

I was reading that Svelte's lifecycle hooks could be called outside of a Svelte component.  I tried this out in the class I started to build out yesterday for managing player data.  It functions, but it made the class a lot harder to unit test, since any unit tests with the class would have to basically create a "test  wrapper" Svelte component so that the lifecycle methods would work properly.  This is probably not the end of the world, because it creates a good barrier between Svelte code and portable logic code.  One pattern that I did try and like, though, was storing the values/methods  that I would be wanting to call with the `onMount` hook in the class.  The end result of what this looks like in a Svelte component would be this:

```typescript
let playerDataService: PlayerDataService;

onMount(() => {
	playerDataService = new PlayerDataService();

	return () => playerDataService.unsubscribe();
});

let playerData = playerDataService?.playerData;
//do cool UI stuff with the player data
```


**What I struggled with

Nothing, really
